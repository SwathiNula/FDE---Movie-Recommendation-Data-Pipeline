🎬 Movie Recommendation System – Data Pipeline Project
📌 Overview

This project implements a Movie Recommendation System using the MovieLens 100K Dataset.
It demonstrates how to build a data pipeline that preprocesses data, analyzes movie ratings, and recommends similar movies based on Pearson correlation.
The system is implemented in Python, combining data analysis, visualization, and recommendation logic to deliver intelligent and explainable results.

🧠 Objective

The main goal of this project is to help users discover movies similar to the ones they like.
The project aims to:

Develop a complete movie recommendation pipeline.

Analyze and preprocess real-world rating data.

Compute correlations between movies using collaborative filtering.

Visualize the top recommended movies.

Export results for reuse or integration with other systems.

📦 Technologies Used
Tool	Purpose
🐍 Python 3.9+	Programming language for implementation
📊 Pandas	Data loading, preprocessing, merging
🔢 NumPy	Numerical and matrix operations
📈 Matplotlib / Seaborn	Visualization of recommendations
🧮 Scikit-learn (optional)	Statistical computation and correlation
☁️ Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook	Development and execution environment
📁 Dataset

The project uses the MovieLens 100K dataset, available at:
🔗 https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/

Dataset files used:

u.item → contains movie details (ID, title, genres)

u.data → contains user ratings for movies

⚙️ Installation & Setup

To run this project locally or on Google Colab:

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Movie-Recommendation-System.git

# Navigate to project folder
cd Movie-Recommendation-System

# Install dependencies
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn


Upload your dataset files (u.item and u.data) to the same directory or Google Colab session before running.

🚀 Usage

Run the main Python file or open the Colab notebook:

python movie_recommendation_pipeline.py


The pipeline will:

Load and preprocess the datasets.

Merge movie and rating information.

Generate a user–movie matrix.

Compute correlations between movies.

Display and save top recommendations.

📊 Example Output

Input:
Toy Story (1995)

Output:
Top 10 similar movies ranked by correlation score.

A bar chart is also generated and saved as:
movie_recommendations_chart.png

CSV Output File:
recommendations.csv

🧠 Recommendation Logic

The system uses Collaborative Filtering based on Pearson Correlation:

Each movie is treated as a vector of user ratings.

Similarity between movies is calculated by comparing rating patterns.

Movies with the highest correlation to the selected title are recommended.

A minimum rating count filter ensures reliability of recommendations.

🧾 Results

Successfully recommends movies with high similarity scores.

Visualizes results clearly for easy interpretation.

Efficiently processes datasets with minimal preprocessing.

Can be easily extended to hybrid or deep learning–based systems.

💡 Future Enhancements

Implement a Content-Based Recommendation System using movie metadata.

Add Hybrid Filtering combining content and collaborative methods.

Integrate with a web interface or API endpoint.

Use deep learning models (e.g., Autoencoders, Neural CF) for advanced recommendations.




This project demonstrates how data engineering and statistical methods can be combined to build a practical, efficient, and interpretable movie recommendation pipeline.
The approach highlights the importance of structured data processing and provides a foundation for more advanced AI-driven recommendation systems.
